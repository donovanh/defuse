				<section>
					<h2>Mr Bean</h2>
          <p>So, have you ever found yourself halfway through a project, and you're like "wait a minute" how is that going to move? Yeah let's talk about that</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>css animation rocks</h2>
          <p>I've been writing tutorials for a long while on making animations using CSS and HTML. I've created logo animations, ways of animating in list items, even created the classic Mac Plus in CSS.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>?</h2>
          <p>But a question that often comes up, is how do we think about animation on large projects. How do we make it consistent. Can we use animation to help the UX of what we build?
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>yep</h2>
          <p>Of course. Animation can help in many ways. Whether it's showing or hiding content, or drawing attention to what matters to guide our visitors.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Lamp/Pixar Lamp/Anchorman</h2>
          <p>Animation also speaks to us on a deeper level. We can take a lamp, and it's just a lamp, but make it move... and people love the lamp.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Stripe example</h2>
          <p>It can also help brands. A recent example was Stripe, who famously took a boring payment modal and gave it character through lots of subtle animations.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Afterthought</h2>
          <p>So the problem, how do we make animation less of an afterthought. How do we avoid this situation where we're having to decide every animation at the last minute.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Style guide image</h2>
          <p>Let's start with the style guide. We've all used them, maybe even created them. These are documents of our fonts, colours, layouts for our brand.
				</section>

        <section>
          <h2>Style Guide</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Fonts</li>
            <li>Colours</li>
            <li>Layouts</li>
            <li><strong>Animations?</strong></li></h2>
            <p>Let's say we want to put animation in here, as something just as important as fonts, colours, layouts and the rest. How might we do that?
        </section>

				<section>
					<h2>Everything is a character</h2>
          <p>Now I'm not saying is the only way to do this, but you can start by thinking of your brand as a character. Like a person. What sort of words would you use to describe your brand's character?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Andrex puppy</h2>
          <p>Let's take a moment to think. What words best represent your brand?</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Kitman Words</h2>
          <p>Here's what we came up with for Kitman Labs. This gave us a starting point for how we could design animations more deliberately.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Overview image</h2>
          <p>The next step is to document it. We created a web page that set out the overall goals of our animations, and the sort of character they would have.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Animate all the things</h2>
          <p>Now we didn't want to just animate for the sake of it. We could use this document to design animations that align with the character we want to portray.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Buttons</h2>
          <p>As we design our projects, we can look to the animation guide for help in deciding what sort of character we give each component. We can then document these decisions.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Components from IBM</h2>
          <p>And the result? Over time you create this repository of knowledge, all the components documented. (This is IBM by the way)
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Google Material, IBM Design Patterns</h2>
          <p>So, take a look around at what other's are doing. Google and IBM both set out lots of great examples in their online style guidelines.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Pattern Lab</h2>
          <p>And if you need a framework for a style guide, a good one to start with is Pattern Lab. It's free - and gives you a great starting point for developing your own style guide.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Style guide title with list of Fonts / Colours / Layouts / Animations (tick next to animations)</h2>
          <p>Let's elevate animation to the level of fonts and layout. Let's design our animations deliberately. Let's let animation play a part in defining our brand's character.
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>I love lamp</h2>
          <p>And maybe people will love your brand too. Thank you!</p>
